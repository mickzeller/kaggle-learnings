    "If the explanation is #1 (“They haven't built new houses where this data was collected”), then, we still should consider the elapsed time and its effects, such as asset depreciation. We could build a model that contemplates this sort of features, or changes to the original model should be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the reason’s #2 (“The data was collected a long time ago. Houses built after the data publication wouldn't show up”), then we’d probably have an outdated model (as in obsolete already).\n",
    "\n",
    "Either way, it depends a lot on the way the model is being used, and what we expect of the model itself. For instance, if we train the model on data from certain city, we shouldn’t be expecting great predictions when studying another city with big differences (great contrast between their markets along with other things). If it’s not a big city but a small town in which things don’t tend to change that often (or quickly), the built model is more likely to be useful for longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the data is from Iowa is a good start into understanding what’s happening, even without digging into the data; for example, the state of Iowa is below the average in population for US states (known from before). But there are many elements (data, facts, etc.) to take advantage of. If we check on YearBuilt, we’ll see that there are several houses in our dataset that were built in the same year as the determined as “newest”, also from the year before; so, it’d be strange, at the very least, if they simply suddenly stop “making” houses. Moreover, there are not registered sales after 2010, which is a striking fact and would potentially make a vast majority agree that the actual reason is #2 (if the latter was not enough).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, it might be a problem depending on our needs; it wouldn’t be surprising if it is. And there are many ways to try to explain the whole case."
